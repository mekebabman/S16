A simple specification for S16's boot record.

File to load?: 
    > "system      " (12 bytes)

File attributes?:
    > Read-only (bit 0),
    > System (bit 1)

Load file in memory at?: 
    > 0000:0500h

Set before performing a far jump to file?:
    > "dl" should contain the boot drive.

Recommended Implemnation:

1 disable interrupts to ensure safety.
2 load the root directory into memory.
3 navigate through the root directory until you find "system      " with attributes read-only, and system.
4 if successful then load the block tables into memory, if not then error.
5 use the 2nd field (000Ch) in the file table to get the byte offset for the block table.
6 use the 4th field (000Fh) in the file table to figure out how many blocks to read linearly starting from the first block in the block table.
7 read all of the files blocks from the block table to memory at 0000:0500h
8 put the boot drive into "dl"
9 perform a far jump to 0000:0500h 

If error:

1 set video mode to 80x25 (int 10,00h with al = 03)
2 write "Boot error!" to the screen
3 write "Press any key to reboot.." on a newline
4 enable interrupts
5 wait for key press (int 16,00h)
6 cold reboot with (int 19h)

Notes:

S16's system file does not care about the boot record! It simply just assumes its already been loaded into memory at 0000:0500h with "cs" being
0000h, "ip" being 0500h, and the boot drive being in "dl". It doesn't care or look for any caches dumped into memory by the boot record! 

Feel free to implement the boot record in anyway you want as long as you load S16's system file properly.
